Before you know it, you're in a bad, dark place.I'm not actually sure you want to change. At the moment you are holding things together; your daughter is not particularly affected, your finances are ok, you're managing to conceal your addiction in real life. You won't stay on that even keel, your life will start imploding if you don't stop.Take the advice given to you here. Delete all numbers on your phone of anyone associated with your habit. Do not socialise with cocaine users. At this early stage you need to remove every temptation. Stop drinking alcohol until you are a long time clean, it will ruin your resolve. Remove all paraphernalia associated with using from your home; whatever you cut up with, the mirror etc.You need to be prepared for the fight of your life with this. The intense high/ euphoria will be replaced by depression, panic and anxiety and severe cravings. It's going to take a lot to battle that on your own. I strongly advise contacting a NA group near you. As the name suggests, it's anonymous, there is no danger of your daughter being taken away or your family finding out.You are putting yourself at risk of stroke, heart problems, seizures, liver damage. Long term use causes infertility. The blood or tissue you might see coming from your nose is the lining rotting away. Eventually your nose will collapse and it's not pretty. You also risk long term mental health problems. Paranoia, anxiety and depression are common after using long term.I'm being harsh but you seem to be at a crossroads. It either sink or swim. Please seek help if you can't do this on your own. Picking up the phone to speak to the Samaritans when you are experiencing intense craving may help.

Well done everyone!!  and  to all who need them!I have a story - I am a (unlikely) success story! A good few years ago I had a heavy cocaine habit. It went hand in hand with the barwork I did when I was younger. I think for about a year or so I kept up weekend/odd cheeky weeknight use which was fun but definitely had a negative influence at the time. I also did some really shitty things while on it, which dented my self esteem and worth. My relationship was fucked up because of it and I knew that I did not have a healthy relationship with coke at all. Me and DP moved to another close by city so I could stop going out so much. I still found a way and we broke up.After the breakup my usage went up massively. To most nights, before my day job, sometimes in my dayjob, at home alone. I also hung around with some horrible people at the time who I'd never bother with normally. I must say I did make my top three closest friends during my cocaine days though!Anyway I'm not sure how long the really heavy days lasted for but basically it stopped because I ran out of money and couldn't sustain the multiple jobs I was doing to pay for all the partying while I was partying so much. Also it coincided with a summer where there was some lovely very cheap ecstasy pills around. There were definitely some very sad and scary times where I was frantically googling stuff like 'shit I'm a coke addict' or when friends used to pull me up on my coke consumption I used to make a joke out of it but really I'd be horrified. I think I decided to change my relationship with it when I'd bought a few grams for me to stay home alone with because I thought that was really sad. Maybe. I'm not really sure when the turning point was but there was one. It took about 1-2 years for the association with drinking to go. I always used to want to ring a bag in as soon as I'd had a sip of something alcoholic  but it's gone. I also couldn't listen to certain music without wanting coke. I think coke changes something in your brain but I am proof that you can change it back again.I still take it now and again but I can honestly take it or leave it. I've had a baby since so my opportunities to go out and get on it are very limited and I like to think I'd never have it in the house. Well I am confident I wouldn't. I'll always be very careful with it now, I've turned jobs down where I've suspected heavy coke use among the staff because I think I could easily get back in the habit if I was around it all the time. Most of my close friends have lost a year or two to heavy drug use but we're all trying to be reasonable people now so none of us take drugs regularly. Festivals and special birthdays. Ultimately, I'll always love getting wrecked by one way or another but being wrecked all the time is not conducive to a nice life.Sorry if this is rambly I'm on my phone I read Grace Jones' autobiography the other month and she had an inspiring attitude to drugs.

You are all doing so well, keep it up!I spent yesterday evening looking after a very young man who missed the doctor on Saturday evening and was experiencing such bad opiate withdrawals his whole body was jerking and he was howling. Gave him 10mg diazepam, 135mg mebeverine, 1g paracetamol, 600mg ibuprofen, 4mg loperamide and 10mg metoclopromide, then let him lay on the couch in my clinic for an hour whilst I played some relaxing music, gave him a hot cup of tea and we chatted whilst I did my paper work. The prison officers weren't very happy about it so I did it under the pretence that he needed monitoring. When he had calmed down I sent him to bed. Haven't seen opiate withdrawals that bad in all the years I have worked in substance misuse. The whole time I just wanted to mother him and give him a hug, it was really hard... it really bought it home how hard stopping drug use can be. Then I came home and read this thread full of hope, and I really needed it as much as you have! So thank you x","Hello!

ILostItInTheEarlyNineties,Tue 31-Jan-17 14:33:29,"Hi Yell welcome to our thread. It sounds as though your DP is in the grips of quite a serious cocaine addiction so you have all my sympathy. It must be hell for you. I got to a point years ago when I was using almost every day and bingeing on it at weekends. I was single at the time and had very few commitments but cocaine soon had a devastating effect on my life at that time. It took me a long time to admit to myself that I was a drug addict, I blamed everything and everyone but myself for my falling apart life!I did pull myself out of my cocaine addiction but as you can see from our thread, old habits have started to creep back. Several years ago I made the decision that I could use cocaine socially but that quickly escalated to relying on it most weekends. That is the place I find myself in now.

","Hi Yell welcome to our thread. It sounds as though your DP is in the grips of quite a serious cocaine addiction so you have all my sympathy. It must be hell for you. I got to a point years ago when I was using almost every day and bingeing on it at weekends. I was single at the time and had very few commitments but cocaine soon had a devastating effect on my life at that time. It took me a long time to admit to myself that I was a drug addict, I blamed everything and everyone but myself for my falling apart life!I did pull myself out of my cocaine addiction but as you can see from our thread, old habits have started to creep back. Several years ago I made the decision that I could use cocaine socially but that quickly escalated to relying on it most weekends. That is the place I find myself in now. On the face of it I have a lovely family and a nice life but I'm well aware of the dangerous position I'm in.I'm not going to dress it up, your dh is going to find conquering his addiction tough. Most importantly, he needs to want to change with every fibre of his body.You sound wonderfully supportive but I think it would really help if your husband has outside support?I know I couldn't have got out of my massive coke addiction without a support network.

NoahsArkxx,Wed 08-Feb-17 21:21:47," I feel amazing! I went to see my uncle the other week and he was ranting on about me smoking (cigarettes) why do you do it? What's the point? It killed my first wife and my father. He then offered me 500 to quit smoking. After leaving his house I thought to myself he had such valid points, I don't even want the money but it just made me think a little more about why I was doing it. I decided I was going to try and quit but thought if I don't smoke fags I will still smoke weed so decided to go cold turkey as suggested by foureyesarebetterthantwo. That Friday i lasted til 9.30pm without a cig or a joint. Then I went down to the rugby club to watch the game and ended up smoking a few then going out after and smoking all night even though I had no fags. On the way back to my house I bought a small pack of tobacco and that still lasted me until today which is longer than usual. That night when I got home I smoked my last joint and decided I wouldn't get any more mainly because I couldn't afford it. I haven't smoked weed since and it feels so good, it's not hard to get up in the morning and I function so well in the day. Now I'm thinking why did I ever get myself so addicted? I decided to quit fags today but I caved and just bought some. Hopefully il quit both soon, even if I do just have the cheeky one when I have a drink. I really just wanted to thank everyone for their advice this post really did help me even though I'm not the OP! Good luck to everyone xx"," I feel amazing!

alicetopp,Tue 07-Feb-17 21:03:18,HiI'm posting on here for some support please. My father is an alcoholic and has been for many years. He is dependent on alcohol too I believe as if he goes a day without it he shakes terribly and sometimes blacks out. Both myself and my mum have had enough. We live in fear every day as to weather or not he will be drunk when we go home. My heart sinks when I walk in to see cans of lager or a bottle of vodka on the kitchen side as I know he will be drunk. Very rarely he will act silly when he's drunk but mostly he will be bitter and argumentative. My poor mum has put up with this for 40 years and god knows why she has! We have tried so many times to help him but it never works. I'm so sad for my mum as one day I will move out and hopefully have a better life but for her this has been her life. She is such a lovely woman and my heart breaks to know she doesn't have the strength to walk away. We have both spent many night crying as I can hear her in her room as my dad slams things around downstairs. I know she must feel terrible for putting me through this but I don't blame her one bit and never will. All we ever want is for him to stop drinking but I fear now the only way we will get out this horror is if he or we were to die. Life is so cruel sometimes.

AnotherEmma,Sun 04-Dec-16 22:34:37,"Two counts of LTB from me (one because he's abusive, two because he's an addict).This is an extract from Lundy Bancroft which I've copied and pasted from The Abuser Profiles thread:""THE MENTALLY ILL OR ADDICTED ABUSERThis last category is not actually separate from the others; an abusive man of any of the aforementioned styles can also have psychiatric or substance-abuse problems, although the majority do not. Even when mental illness or addiction is a factor, it is not the cause of a man's abuse of his partner, but it can contribute to the severity of his problem and his resistance to change. When these additional problems are present, it is important to be aware of the following points:1. Certain mental illnesses can increase the chance that an abuser will be dangerous and use physical violence. These include paranoia, severe depression, delusions or hallucinations (psychosis), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and antisocial personality disorder known as psychopathy or sociopathy). These psychiatric conditions also make it next to impossible for an abuser to change, at least until the mental illness has been brought under control through therapy and/or medication, which can take years. Even if the mental illness is properly treated, his abusiveness won't necessarily change.2. An abuser's reactions to going on or off medication are unpredictable. A woman should take extra precautions for her safety at such a time. Abusers tend to go off medication before longI have had few clients who were consistent and responsible about taking their meds in the long term. They don't like the side effects, and they are too selfish to care about the implications of the mental illness for their partners or children.3. The potential danger of a mentally ill abuser has to be assessed by looking at the severity of his psychiatric symptoms in combination with the severity of his abuse characteristics. Looking at his psychiatric symptoms alone can lead to underestimating how dangerous he is.4. Antisocial personality disorder is present in only a small percentage of abusers but can be important. Those who suffer from this condition lack a conscience and thus are repeatedly involved in behaviors that are harmful to others. Some signs of this condition include: (a) He started getting into illegal behavior when he was still a teenager; (b) his dishonest or aggressive behavior involves situations unrelated to his partner, rather than being restricted to her; (c) he periodically gets into trouble at workplaces or in other contexts for stealing, threatening, or refusing to follow instructions and is likely to have a considerable criminal record by about age thirty, though the offenses may be largely minor ones; (d) he is severely and chronically irresponsible in a way that disrupts the lives of others or creates danger; and (e) he tends to cheat on women a lot, turn them against each other, and maintain shallow relationships with them. The psychopath's physical violence is not necessarily severe, contrary to the popular image, but he may be very dangerous nonetheless. Antisocial personality disorder is very difficult to change through therapy, and there is no effective medication for treating it. It is highly compatible with abusiveness toward women.5. Those who suffer from narcissistic personality disorder have a highly distorted self-image. They are unable to accept that they might have faults and therefore are unable to imagine how other people perceive them. This condition is highly compatible with abusiveness, though it is present in only a small percentage of abusive men. Clues to the presence of this disorder include: (a) Your partner's self-centeredness is severe, and it carries over into situations that don't involve you; (b) he seems to relate everything back to himself; and (c) he is outraged whenever anyone criticizes him and is incapable of considering that he could ever be anything other than kind and generous. This disorder is highly resistant to therapy and is not treatable with medication. The abuser with this disorder is not able to change substantially through an abuser program either, although he sometimes makes some minor improvements.6. Many abusers who are not mentally ill want women to think that they are, in order to avoid responsibility for their attitudes and behavior.Substance abuse, like mental illness, does not cause partner abuse but can increase the risk of violence. Like the mentally ill abuser, the addicted abuser doesn't change unless he deals with his addiction, and even that is only the first step.

Brith,Mon 09-Jan-17 12:02:09,"My DH is a recovering cocaine addict. I knew he was a recovering addict when I met him, and I knew the work he'd put into not using. The key really did seem to be that he acknowledged he had a problem, and he acknowledged that he was the only one responsible for fixing it. Without this (or until this happens), I don't think there's any hope for your DH. You certainly can't do the work for him.It might well be that you have to leave with your children, both to keep yourselves safe (the number one reason) and for him to realise the impact his habit is having. But don't do it for the second reason. Your behaviour cannot impact his: you didn't cause the problem and you can't solve it. In any case, as far as I know from my DH's story and those he is in recovery with, it took more than one hard knock to convince them the issue was with them, not the people around them. Even if he does recover in the future, it's never plain sailing. Even with years into recovery there is the ever-present threat of relapse. The other difficult thing is that there's a temptation to think ""when he gets clean it'll all be ok"", but I can tell you from my experience recovery itself can impact a relationship. My DH works on this EVERY DAY. He did a month in rehab before I met him, then there were relentless meetings. Now he attends meetings three evenings a week, sees a psychologist at least every month, has sponsor meetings, goes to church once a week (this is directly related to keeping clean), and when he's at home he's spending many of his evenings going over and over the AA book, highlighting paragraphs, writing down notes, working, working, working. We talk a LOT about him and his feelings. Not so much about mine.Again, I'm ok with this - I run a busy business and I'm pretty independent, like my own company etc. But if you want a more connected relationship then living with any kind of addict can be a challenge. Only you can tell whether you'd be happy with this, but going back to what everyone else has said, until he sees there's a problem (and that in itself can be a long process of acceptance) he can't really take any steps towards wellness at all.","My DH is a recovering cocaine addict.

Mrsbloggs,Wed 29-Jun-16 09:51:18,"Hi thereI really need some help and advice. I'm at a bit of a loss to be honest with you. I married my man 3 years ago. I took on his four children, although they are teenagers and older, we've had them living with us off and on over the last two years. We have one teenage daughter living with us now and we have two children together (5 months and 2 years.) I have known for a little while that my husband likes to dabble on the gambling. Over the last few years he's wasted a few thousand on it. More recently the amounts have been increasing, so I put my foot down and asked him to have a limit each month. This caused him then to set up a PayPal account with the online betting company and use PayPal for it, so I couldn't see the transactions clearly in the bank. I caught him out and confronted him. He lied to me for days about him spending any more money, but I knew he was lying and I asked him to show me the proof by logging into his PayPal account. Of course there were all the transactions. After it all blew up he promised me he'd never gamble again, but a week later he got paid some money he was owed and then lied to me about what money he was given, so he could have some money for the gambling. He then added money from our joint bank account to his PayPal account and denied doing it. He then asked me if he could spend 5 on gambling at the weekend and I agreed, because I don't know what direction to go in. I thought if I agreed to a small amount weekly it might fulfil his desire and stop him sneaking the money, but I feel that now I've made it worse. He doesn't know I know he's been lying to me. I only know because I check his PayPal account. I feel awful for doing it. There's no trust in our relationship. I can't trust him with money and this worries me. We are meant to have a life together, but I feel our relationship isn't honest at the moment. He knows how much I hate the gambling yet still he does it and disrespects me. Furthermore, his daughter is a compulsive liar and I'm sick of all the lies in our household. It doesn't bode well for our small children. I don't want them being brought up to think it's okay to lie. Any advice about how to handle a gambler would be great. He doesn't blow thousands in a day or anything, but the lies and the consistency of it is enough for me to be concerned about what he could do.Thanks for your help","Hi thereI really need some help and advice.

She said the police just turned up at her door and in a threatening way, said they would ""get her"" and smash her door in to get to her.I tried to talk her through it until she became calmer then asked her permission to try and get someone to help her.

She is also grieving the death of her beloved dog. Her husband works away and all her friends have deserted her. Her son really doesn't want to know because he is ashamed of how she acts in drink.

Allottwant,Tue 29-Nov-16 22:10:36,"Pendlwitch, how is your son doing? We have just discovered our 16 year old daughter is using Xanax heavily, mainly at weekends - she's also smoking weed regularly. We're devastated - knew it was in her social group but thought she was one of the sensible ones! Unfortunately the main supplier is someone she's been absolutely besotted with for a long time with no sign of this changing.Other members of her social group had started getting very worried about her and one talked to her Mum who thankfully contacted me. We talked to her about it - she was relatively open about using but denied taking in the quantities her friend had said. We went to the GP who spoke to her in confidence and then simply reassured us there was not an addiction problem. She obviously didn't tell him how much she was using or how regularly and now GP has said he doesn't think there's an addiction problem she seems to think it's ok to still use. I know she's still planning to continue taking as I saw one of her messages today to the boy who supplies. She has started stealing money and her friends are dropping her as she's trying to blag money from them.

We have just discovered our 16 year old daughter is using Xanax heavily, mainly at weekends - she's also smoking weed regularly. We're devastated - knew it was in her social group but thought she was one of the sensible ones! Unfortunately the main supplier is someone she's been absolutely besotted with for a long time with no sign of this changing.Other members of her social group had started getting very worried about her and one talked to her Mum who thankfully contacted me. We talked to her about it - she was relatively open about using but denied taking in the quantities her friend had said. We went to the GP who spoke to her in confidence and then simply reassured us there was not an addiction problem. She obviously didn't tell him how much she was using or how regularly and now GP has said he doesn't think there's an addiction problem she seems to think it's ok to still use. I know she's still planning to continue taking as I saw one of her messages today to the boy who supplies. She has started stealing money and her friends are dropping her as she's trying to blag money from them.

We get a rise in dopamine and endorphins when we eat - eating is pleasurable, and we get a little high! But this in itself is not going to cause addiction. This is just our survival mechanism telling us that to eat food is a good thing. To be addicted to food or anything else, we also need a stress. The stress could be a difficult relationship, the demands of parenting, anxiety about the future, feeling lonely, or any number of other problematic issues.

It is unlikely that he is obtaining stuff from needle exchange for a friend. Needle track marks can also look like scratches. You are right that if he is using again he is at increased risk of overdose. There is an antidote to heroin overdose that friends or family can obtain and learn to use. It's called naloxone. You can get it from drug services definitely and perhaps from pharmacies. If you are going to approach him about it I would suggest being as non judgemental as possible and strongly encouraging him to seek help. The earlier he can get on a methadone or buprenorphine script and linked in with recovery support the safer he is.
